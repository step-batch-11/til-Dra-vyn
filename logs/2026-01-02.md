# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What *clicked* today? 
  Acceleration, velocity and vectors. And also the snippet configuration.
- What changed in your understanding?
  Vectors are not only related to physics, they also represent dimensions.
- What would you explain differently now?
  Vectors are not only related to physics, they also represent dimensions.

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
  Why do I have to translate back to a different point after rotation? 
  Why can't I specify the centre point and rotate on it's own axis?
- What would you like to see one more example of?
  simple rotation examples, more on different acceleration examples of an object.
- What feels fragile in your understanding?
  Rotation can be confusing as because of the translation. And also, 
  the rate of change of velocity and acceleration may be slightly confuse.

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:
- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- How does the transparency of an object works?
- Why can't I directly been able to give a center point and rotate on it's axis?
- “How does this scale / fail / degrade?”

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- A variation of today’s code
- A small rotation translation example
- A bouncing ball
- A simple pattern with math
