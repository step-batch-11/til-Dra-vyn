# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What *clicked* today?
- Noise in p5.js
- What changed in your understanding?
- Normally, noise returns an output between 0 - 1.
- What would you explain differently now?
- Unlike random, noise is normalized to return values between 0 - 1.

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
- Locked in readable and writable stream
- What would you like to see one more example of?
- decoder.Decode and encoder.Encode
- What feels fragile in your understanding?
- while creating new Text Decoder/Encoder it's returning an object with encoding, fatal, ignoreBOM. what are those?

---

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:
- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- “while creating new Text Decoder/Encoder it's returning an object with encoding, fatal, ignoreBOM. what are those?”
- "Is await only applicable to for of or any other loops”
- “what does that locked and unlocked in readable or writable streams”

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- encoding and decoding problems
- test pipe through and pipe of
- deno.stdin and deno.stdOut
