# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What *clicked* today?
- Deno coverage and dependency injection. As deno coverage will give the 
  no. of lines covered by tests whereas DI will give the control of a function 
  to the user. 
- What changed in your understanding?
- Inversion of control. As some functions are out of user control like 
  Math.random and some other built-in functions, the user will not have any 
  control over that functions. So a user can't test that function.
- What would you explain differently now?
- Dependency injection of a function will give us the control in our own hands.
  In that way we can test our functions easily.

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
- Dependency injection. Still there are some functions which give random values. 
  How can we test the output properly in random values.
- What would you like to see one more example of?
- Dependency injection.
- What feels fragile in your understanding?
- Dependency injection.

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:
- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- “Why does X behave differently when Y?”
- “What breaks if I remove Z?”
- “How does this scale / fail / degrade?”

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- A small program by using DI
- A variation in head assignment

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because **I learned a new command to check whether whole 
lines of code are being covered by the tests or not**.
